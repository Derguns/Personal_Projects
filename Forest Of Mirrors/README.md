This is a repository folder showing some examples from my Website, Forest of Mirrors (http://forestofmirrors.x10.mx/). Please note that 
due to the nature of the site, not all files can be uploaded, as it is user based and some functions rely on the user not knowing how they work.
Any examples given can be further expanded on by request. 

The site is built using the Mysidia Adoptables Framework (http://www.mysidiaadoptables.com/), as its object oriented backing. Any pages uploaded here
are non-standard and not provided with the script and rely on the script's framework for page echos, template loading, and database interaction.
