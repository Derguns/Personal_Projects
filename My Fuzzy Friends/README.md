My Fuzzy Friends was created for the 2018 She Innovates hackaton. 
The idea, art, and some portions of the CSS were not created by me, but the SQL database, PHP files, and their contents were my work. 

The idea is that of a breedable and editable creature website where users (young children) would be able to edit and change their creatures
geneome. This is done by using PHP and an SQL database to save the edits made to the individual creature. More creatures can be added into the 
database and edited through a GET call from the URL, however this functionality was not needed for the demo.

Additionally, the website where the working product is located can be found here: https://myfuzzyfriends.000webhostapp.com/ .
